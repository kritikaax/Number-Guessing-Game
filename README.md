# Number-Guessing-Game
The purpose of the Number Guessing Game project is to create a simple, interactive game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. This project allowed me to apply Python programming basics, including control structures, random number generation, and error handling.
The scope of the Number Guessing Game project is focused on providing a straightforward, console-based interaction where a single player can guess a randomly generated number within a defined range. By keeping the interaction limited to the console, this project emphasizes core programming skills, such as control flow, loops, conditional statements, and error handling, without introducing the additional complexity of a graphical user interface. The game design intentionally excludes multi-user capabilities, persistent storage, scoring, or difficulty levels, as the primary goal is to create a simple, interactive experience to practice foundational Python concepts. This limited scope ensures the project remains manageable, while also allowing a clear focus on developing skills in handling user input, managing control structures, and debugging basic logic. The game serves as an excellent exercise in essential programming techniques, especially for beginners, while also leaving open possibilities for future enhancements as programming proficiency grows.
